#React leraning  
Dear Abhishek Sir,

Here is my daily work log for today:

Learned various Node.js concepts, including middlewares, authentication using JWT, and data validation with Zod.

Explored Helmet for enhancing backend application security.

Completed hands-on practice to implement these concepts in sample Node.js applications.

Best Regards,
Ajit Waman
